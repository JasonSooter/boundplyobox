Hello & Welcome to Bound Plyo Box ðŸ‘‹,

We appreciate you stopping by.

We specialize in producing strong Plyo Boxes in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We're proud to be completely Made in America.

Our Plyo Boxes are made with a premium grade plywood from Radiata Pine grown in sustainable forests. We produce our boxes with an efficient, accurate, and large scale CNC Router. Using a CNC router allows us to get very accurate parts to make a tight box that when assembled will be strong even before using screws. All flat-packed plyo boxes come with instructions and screws needed for assembly.

An important distinction we strive to make is that our focus is only on making a superior plyo box and not on spreading our resources thin for the many other fitness categories that exist. This focused effort allows us to offer a superior box for a fair price.

We're happy to work with someone looking to improve their home gym or a gym needing a whole set of custom branded boxes.

We look forward to hearing from you!
